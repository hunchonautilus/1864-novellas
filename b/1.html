    <h2><br><br>5 December, 1864: The 18th Brumaire of Benjamin Butler<br><br><br><br><br></h2>
    <p><b>Manhattan</b></p>
    <p>Black boots clomped along the hardwood floor of the Tammany Hall building on the corner of Nassau and Frankfort. A regiment of rifle-wielding young men, in bright red shirts with blue sashes, marched through the hallways, shoving past any man who tried to stop them. At their head was a lanky Swabian with a long, pointed beard, donning the red and yellow cockade of the Baden revolution, medals befitting his rank as a Colonel, and his famous slouch hat with a red feather. His gait was intense, and Tammany staffers could see that his face betrayed both anxiety and unfaltering determination.</p>
    <p>The Swabian and his men walked up to the doors of Boss Tweed’s office, and flung them wide open. Tweed sat in his chair, scribbling a missive. The boss looked up at the grim figure of the bearded man standing before him.<br><br><br><br></p>

    <p>“Who in God’s name are you?” he managed to blurt out before two redshirts approached and grabbed him by the arms. “What the hell are you doing?”</p>
    <p>“William Tweed,” spoke Hecker, ominously, revealing his accent. “You are being placed under arrest by the order of General Butler.”</p>
    <p>“Butler?” Tweed spat, resisting the hold of the soldiers. “Butler is in New York?”</p>
    <p><br><br><br><br>The grim-faced Colonel did not reply, but instead beckoned his men, who dragged Tweed from his chair with great effort, and stood him on his feet.</p>
    <p><br><br><br><br><br><br>“You bastard, you- you can’t do this!” protested Tweed. “Who the hell do you think you are?”</p>
    <p>“I am Colonel Friedrich Hecker. General Butler is in Washington. You are being charged for conspiracy to commit electoral fraud, among other things…”<br><br><br><br><br><br></p>
    <figure><img src="im3.png"><figcaption>Colonel Hecker.</figcaption></figure>
    <p>Tweed began to protest loudly as Hecker read the charges from a list. Racketeering, embezzlement, grand theft—the list went on. After the tenth charge, Tweed broke free of his bonds. One of the soldiers hit him hard in the gut with a rifle butt, sending him keeling to the floor.</p>
    <p>Hecker produced a pistol—a small pepperbox derringer—and pointed it at the sweating, portly Tweed.</p>
    <p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>“I would reconsider whatever intention have you for making an escape, Mr. Tweed.”</p>
    <p>“This is… outrageous!” the boss shouted, panting as he rose from the ground. “By what authority do you detain me? By what law, you Dutch fucking louse?”</p>
    <p><br><br><br><br>The Colonel did not flinch at this insult. He turned around and nodded to his cohort, which must have been at least fifty men, most of whom began to filter through the halls of the Wigwam in search of targets for arrest.</p>
    <p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>“By the order of the Provisional Commander-in-Chief of the United States Armed Forces, the Tammany Society is hereby dissolved, and its assets seized by the provisional government of the State of New York.”</p>
    <figure><img src="im4.png" style="width:auto;height:auto;"></figure>
    <p>“Provisional government,” Tweed sputtered. “Have you lost your mind, man? When Lincoln—”</p>
    <p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b><span style="text-shadow:0 0 10px #fff;">“Lincoln is dead.”</span></b></p>
    <p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Tweed’s eyes went wide. He tried to find the words, but could not find it in himself to say anything as the Colonel leveled his pistol at the boss’s head.</p>
    <p><br><br><br><br>“On second thought,” Hecker mused. “I think I will save myself the trouble.”</p>
    <p><br><br>He pulled the trigger, and what was left of Boss Tweed crumpled to the floor.</p>
