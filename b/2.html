    <p><b>Washington</b></p>
    <p>At five before three o’clock in the afternoon, the House of Representatives reconvened on the first day of its new session, after a short break, to continue debate around the Thirteenth Amendment. While James Ashley stood first to speak, the doors of the House burst open and a young man in a white shirt shouted something—whatever it was got lost in the noise as the Congressmen turned their heads to decry this interruption.</p>
    <p><br>“Order!” yelled Schuyler Colfax, banging a gavel loudly. “There will be order!”</p>
    <p><br>The House quieted as the young man continued to shriek. He sucked in a breath, and shouted as loud as he could:</p>
    <p><br>“Lincoln has been shot!”</p>
    <p><br>Calamity broke out. The bewildered representatives looked amongst themselves. Cries of “who? who?” erupted.</p>
    <p><br>“Down the street!” yelled the flustered, exhausted boy, his voice nearly failing him. “Don’t know who it was, but there was a lot of ‘em! Shot him dead!”</p>
    <p><br>The Congress gasped in unison. No sooner did the young man gather his breath for another shout that a line of soldiers streamed into the House, led at the fore by an immense, stout figure in uniform. Bald head, puggish nose, crossed eyes, and drooping moustache: it was none other than the Beast himself. The soldiers knocked the boy out of the way and stood at attention behind their leader. The nervous herald of the shocking news quickly made for the exit, unmolested by the phenomenally tall soldiers holding bayoneted rifles to their sides.<br><br></p>
    <figure><img src="im7.png"><figcaption>Beast Butler.</figcaption></figure>
    <p>“Butler!” Colfax shouted angrily. “What on earth is going on?”</p>
    <p><br>The General did not respond immediately, but instead clasped his hands together, waiting patiently for the noise to die down. In a few seconds, when outrage gave way to concerned silence, he spoke softly but firmly.</p>
    <p><br>“A few minutes ago, President Lincoln was shot by a gang of assassins whilst strolling by the War Department. The criminals have been apprehended, and confessions extracted.”</p>
    <p><br>“Does he live?” questioned George Pendleton, piping up from the front of the House.</p>
    <p><br>“The President expired at four minutes past two-thirty this afternoon,” replied Butler promptly.</p>
    <p><br>The House erupted once more, the gathered Congressmen sent into a near-frenzy. “Preposterous!” cried some; the wide-eyed hacks bleated like sheep amongst each other, some now knowing that their house of cards was imminently due to come crashing down.</p>
    <p><br>“Where is Hamlin?” yelled Montgomery Blair before bowing in a fit of coughs; he was echoed by several white-haired representatives in a cacophony of voices.</p>
    <p><br>“Order!” yelled Colfax again, quieting the riotous noise to make way for Butler to speak. His words did little to soothe the frayed nerves of the Congress—the cold formality of the General’s tone put them deeply at unease.</p>
    <p><br>“The whereabouts of the Vice President are unknown,” said Butler. “The assassins have alleged to have succeeded in plots to murder both him and William Seward earlier this morning, and attempts to make contact are ongoing.”</p>
    <figure><img src="im8.png"><figcaption>The House, in pandemonium.</figcaption></figure>
    <p><br><br>Another loud response from the crowd. The distinguished gentlemen of the House had at once become a group of uproarious rabble. There were some among them who acted in a manner befitting such a calamity; but, in a most suspect fashion, some gazed upon Butler with stone cold fear. Whether or not this was an indication of guilt or awe at the feat being pulled before them could be left to history.</p>
    <p>After some moments of interruption, the General cocked his head and opened his mouth half-way, as if to command their attention for the next mortar he was about to fire upon this cherished hall of discussion and decorum. When outrage gave way to expectant silence, again he spoke:</p>
    <p><br>“I have come to this House with evidence that a number of lawmakers associating with the Democracy were complicit in this plot.”</p>
    <p><br><br>An uproar! Democrats of all stripes rose from their seats and protested loudly. Butler began to point at certain sections of the room, and his soldiers proceeded down the aisles to take the suspects into custody. Colfax, utterly stunned, resigned himself to sit down and watch the proceedings.</p>
    <p><br>“The scale of this plot against our Republic is gravely large,” Butler raised his voice as the thundering footsteps of his men threatened to drown him out. “We have collected evidence that these men were involved in the provocations that sparked last month’s riots in Manhattan, a scheme produced by these members acting in accord with the Knights of the Golden Circle to undermine the government and its prosecution of the war. They have conspired to commit fraud of a fearsome scale, and carried out unspeakable acts of treason against our Union. On this basis—”</p>
    <p><br><br>“Ben, you traitor!” boomed Fernando Wood, swatting away a soldier and making his way to the entrance to meet the General. The normally cool gentleman from New York displayed a demeanor of apoplectic rage.</p>
    <figure><img src="im9.png" style="height:auto;"><figcaption>Fernando Wood.</figcaption></figure>
    <p>“This will not stand! You betray the constitution and the Union itself!”</p>
    <p><br>Two soldiers stepped in front of Butler to block Wood’s path. The House fell silent once more, watching the confrontation with grim suspicion.</p>
    <p><br>“Mr. Wood,” Butler spoke, placing his hand on the revolver holstered to his side. “You are a man of great conviction and principle, and for that you have always commanded my respect.”</p>
    <p><br><br><br><br>He paused a moment. The House was hopelessly captive to his words.</p>
    <p>“But,” he continued. “If you attempt to obstruct me in this matter, I will shoot you dead.”</p>
    <p><br><br>Wood’s eyes widened. He took a sharp breath, and nervously backed away. Butler pointed at the tall man, and the two guards to his front seized Wood by the arms and dragged him away. The flamboyant trickster of New York had nothing to say, but only wept, as he was carried off.</p>
    <p><br>“On this basis,” Butler continued, not in the least flummoxed. No one would dare interrupt him now. “I have acted to suspend the normal proceedings of the federal government on a temporary basis; to restore order throughout the Union, to investigate and bring to trial the conspirators behind the plot against our Republic and constitution, and to ensure the most legitimate government is inaugurated at the turn of the next year, that we may seal our victory against the rebellion.”</p>
    <p><br><br><br><br><br><br>The gravity of what was unfolding had by now been fully realized by the members assembled. One by one, the most notable and passionate agitators against the war were seized and carried off, few among them giving any trouble to their arrestors. Butler read their names from a list as his orderlies walked them out in single file, and the House watched silently as they went.</p>
    <p><br><br>Alexander Long. Daniel Voorhees. Joseph White. James Robinson. Benjamin Wood, brother of Fernando, whose inaction in the moments prior revealed all there was to know of his character, and James Brooks, Fernando’s loyal lieutenant.</p>
    <p>Benjamin Harris, only months ago censured for his open support for the Confederacy, wrestled free of one lanky soldier and threw for a punch; the old man was kicked near-bloody to the ground, and dragged off before his horrified colleagues. Lewis Ross, of whom no one could say that he did not try in his utmost to find a solution to the present conflict in good faith, gave no resistance, and only looked down with an ashen face as he was taken away. It was this that told the entire room for certain what they knew to be true in their hearts.</p>
    <p>One such as Ross may have expected more resistance from his colleagues on the Democratic side, but they could do nothing but gaze helplessly into the pitiful eyes of the men being marched presumably to their doom; in that moment, the coup was fait accompli.</p>
    <p>Last to the call was George Pendleton. Having woken up that morning jubilant, ready to conclude his final session of Congress before ascending the Vice Presidency, he found himself three months early to the end of his career. He said nothing, but flashed a hate-filled glare at Butler as he was led away.</p>
    <p>And then it was done. The remaining members of the House sat (some stood) in silence. What Democrats were left were surely grateful to remain in the room. The Republicans watched with consternation. Some, mostly Radicals, seemed devilishly impressed by General Butler’s audacity. The pluck of that man.</p>
    <p><br><br><br><br><br><br>“Mr. Colfax,” Butler commanded, breaking the air. “Would you kindly tell your colleagues that the affairs of the House are to be adjourned for the day?”</p>
    <figure><img src="im10.png"><figcaption>Hon. Colfax.</figcaption></figure>
    <p><br>He stepped forward, onto the floor of the House, and gazed upon its members. Most looked to be intensely scared of him. Some stared with intense hatred at the object of their rage. Good. He liked that very much.</p>
    <p><br>“Gentlemen,” he said, after some delay. “Go home.”</p>
    <p><br><br><br><br>All in all, the House looked short of some twenty or thirty members. A fearful Colfax banged his gavel and whimpered “so it is ordered.” Slowly, the mass of legislators began to quietly shuffle out of the room, the line of soldiers giving way to their passage, though not without doling out some intimidating glances.</p>
    <p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Within minutes, only Colfax and Thaddeus Stevens, still sitting, remained. Butler strode to the Speaker’s podium and beckoned Colfax to come down.</p>
    <p><br><br><br><br>“So that’s how it is, Ben?” Stevens cawed. “You wish to be Napoleon then?”</p>
    <figure><img src="im11.png"><figcaption>Thaddeus Stevens.</figcaption></figure>
    <p><br>Butler let out a deep breath and tapped his foot a moment. He grimaced, and looked dully at the Old Commoner.</p>
    <p>“Do not say to me, Thad, that you did not think this might happen.”</p>
    <p><br>Stevens looked down at his feet.</p>
    <p>“I had hoped it might not come to pass,” he sighed.</p>
    <p><br>Colfax nervously approached the General.</p>
    <p>“The President is truly dead, then?”</p>
    <p><br>Butler nodded sorrowfully.</p>
    <p><br>“He didn’t even have a chance. The assailants shot him thro’ the heart and elsewhere.”</p>
    <p><br>“On whose orders?” asked Stevens, more rhetorically than anything.</p>
    <p><br>“It looks at this moment to be the work of Vallandigham,” Butler said. “But that is all I can say without drifting into speculation.”</p>
    <p><br>Stevens was not entirely convinced of the verity in the General’s response. In fact, he didn’t believe a word of it. But he nodded anyway.</p>
    <p><br>“What next?” Colfax inquired.</p>
    <p><br>Butler leaned back against the edge of the foremost seat in the House.</p>
    <p>“Well, sir, I imagine we will have to send word to our Generals on the front that the government in Washington has been compromised, and declare a state of emergency.”</p>
    <p><br>“You already have,” Stevens surmised. Butler did not respond, but continued.</p>
    <p><br>“It is the position of the government that the extremist peace faction of the Democracy, in league with Clement Vallandigham, conspired to murder the President and clear the way for a government of graybacks and Copperheads. They conspired to rig the elections of the states, and elect their unknowing lackey, McClellan, to the Presidency.”</p>
    <p><br>“Does Seward live?” asked Colfax.</p>
    <p><br>“I very much doubt it.”</p>
    <p><br>Stevens nodded slowly, and then spoke coldly.</p>
    <p>“So we are to have martial law, then. All right. And what will become of those men you just had dragged out there by the ear?”</p>
    <p><br>“They will be tried,” Butler said. “And most likely the whole lot of them will be found guilty, and sent away to prison.”</p>
    <p><br>“And so we will govern without them,” said Stevens. “A rump. A body of like-minded fellows, existing only to affirm your decrees.”</p>
    <p><br>“I would not put it so odiously as that, Mr. Stevens,” retorted Butler. “Our objective is to preserve the Republic against the forces of slavery and slaver’s ilk—is that not what you have desired to accomplish throughout your long and illustrious career?”</p>
    <p><br>Stevens grumbled.</p>
    <p><br><br><br><br>“We will strengthen the foundations of our Union,” the General continued. “And ensure at the end that every man in it shall have the ballot under a republican government. And when Lee surrenders, as I am sure he is shortly to do, we will take the rebel leadership for captives, and stand them to a man upon the gallows.”</p>
    <p><br>Colfax was horrified, but knew he was powerless to do anything about it. Stevens nodded along; he knew the die to be cast, and himself an unwitting hand in its throwing upon the board.</p>
    <p><br>“Then, I imagine,” Butler said with an air of hope, though Stevens looked through the pretense and saw at its root only raw, unfettered ego. “We shall make war upon the bandits and partisans in the hills and forests. We will burn the plantations, declare in totality the emancipation of all colored folk, and declare this war won, and the Republic preserved in perpetuity. We will give the franchise to every negro in the land, and have their votes assured. And then, and only then, I will take my leave from the stage. I will travel to the ends of the earth if it will ensure us to have a free republic, a perpetual republic, until kingdom comes.”</p>
    <p><br>“Knowingly or not, a co-conspirator. I am quite certain he will give way, after a week of hemming and hawing - the only thing he’s been good for in this fight - and if he sees fit to contest me, he will live out the rest of his days in a cell.”</p>
    <p><br><br><br><br>“Checkmate,” muttered Stevens. He lifted his head, and repeated: “Checkmate! You’re a rat bastard, Ben Butler. You had better know damn well what you’re doing.”</p>
    <p>He sank once more, defeated, chin touching his chest.</p>
    <p>“Abe… old Abe. He didn’t deserve it.”</p>
    <p><br><br><br><br>Butler nodded, and turned to Colfax to explain his plan of action in point order.</p>
    <p>“Mr. Colfax, you may reconvene the House tomorrow morning. I will call both houses of Congress together, and declare to them my intentions to do all in my power to maintain this Republic and its laws. Congress will reject the Democrat electors sent by way of fraud, and accept Republican slates across the North, except those states for which it can be reasonably assumed that McClellan should have carried them. We will find out if Hamlin is alive, though my hopes are dim, and if he is not, then we will put Dan Clark in the office until March, whereupon I will be inaugurated as the duly elected President of the United States. Do you understand me clearly?</p>
    <p><br>Colfax gulped and nodded.</p>
    <p>“I-” he began, but was unable to find the words. Butler clapped him on the shoulder.</p>
    <p><br>“There’s a good man.”</p>
    <p>He cocked a smile, patted Colfax again on the back, wheeled about, and began to walk out of the room, followed by soldiers.</p>
    <p><br><br>“I will call on your office tomorrow, Thad,” Butler declared as he made his exit, turning to throw his arms out and take a grand bow. “Tell Henry Winter Davis to write me as soon as possible. I think I’ll make him my Secretary of State!”</p>
    <p><br><br><br><br><br><br>Stevens looked up at Colfax, who only now could breathe calmly. The Speaker of the House, typically warm and affable, was seized by dread. The old curmudgeon that was Thaddeus Stevens was, in a rare turn of events, lost for words. The only thing he could muster escaped him quietly, once all the soldiers had gone.</p>
    <p><br><br><br><br>“Well, shit.”</p>
