    <h2><br><br>The Perpetual Republic<br><br><br><br><br></h2>
    <p>Benjamin F. Butler will ascend to the Presidency following your untimely death. With the Union rattled by your assassination, the riots in New York and the great controversy around his spot on the ticket, he will find himself in a precarious position. To his great luck, however, his sworn enemy William Seward has died along with you after repeated stabs to the throat, making Butler’s path to power that much easier. The unanimity of your victory in November’s election has given him a mandate like no other, unparalleled in scope since James Monroe’s drubbing of the Federalists in 1820. Furthermore, his efforts to rally the abolitionist bloc while serving as your loyal lieutenant has allowed Butler to ingratiate himself with the Radical caucus of the Republican Party, many of them chomping at the bit to enforce immediate abolition and a Radical Reconstruction.</p>
    <p><br>Ever the chameleon, Butler would proceed cautiously at first, ensuring he knew who his friends were, and who only pretended to be so. In the months following his coming to power, he would carefully maneuver to pass legislation and use a combination of charm and implicit threats to bribe, bully and harangue the Congress to bow to his will. In doing so, he would shed his reputation as an inept General, and find that his ability to intimidate those in the halls of power, bolstered by his loyal following among the commonfolk, shall come to see him crossing every limit set against him with ease.</p>
    <p><br>Yea, the establishment knew not what they did when they accepted that this puggish man was to be their Commander. With every bombastic reach for more power, the ease with which he was able to divide his opposition would leave his enemies always two steps behind. Pointing to evidence of a vast conspiracy to destroy the Republic, his Radical backers ensured that any man speaking in protest of his increasingly dictatorial tendencies could be slandered as a traitor—persistence would lead to visitations in the nighttime; visitations would lead to disappearance; disappearance saw one’s very name damned to memory, the heads of their colleagues turned along with their ears and eyes, that their name may never be spoken again, and proof of their very existence ultimately undone in totality. Such was the awesome power unleashed upon the United States upon the elevation of a man who saw no principle too dear to forsake in pursuit of power, and the complete subordination of the ruling class to him.</p>
    <p><br>It did not have to be this way. But once the Radicals of the Congress finally tasted power, each of them in turn forsook their principles to cede ever more power to the executive. Those who did not were left by the wayside; blind eyes were turned to the increasing number of Democratic legislators, colleagues with whom they once mixed as gentlemen, who were tried and thrown away on sedition charges. Numerous enabling acts were passed, and the House continued to fill up with Republicans. Those who advocated a more moderate course would be reasoned with; those who demanded one would find themselves denied the Party’s endorsement for their next term.</p>
    <p><br>Party-issued “Union Tickets” became a commodity for any man who wanted to keep his seat, facilitating the entry of many northern Democrats into the Republican Party. To have the endorsement of Butler and his machine became the defining trait of any winning candidate. The process of amalgamating all branches of politics into one broad coalition was a careful one, as putting away too many Democrats, rigging too many elections, would break the intricately-laid veil of the President’s machinations. But slowly and surely, year by year, these surreptitious methods of fraud and intimidation paid off, and by the eighth year of his Presidency, Butler had a Congress utterly captive to his will.</p>
    <p><br>Butler could, at any moment where it might be of use, cast himself as the American Gracchus, Cincinnatus, or Caesar: it depended only on who needed to hear the gospel of liberty, and by what means they may be convinced to accept that he, and only he, could truly rid the nation of its sins. The swift execution of the entire Confederate leadership put an end to any dream of peaceful reconciliation. No, that was not practical, nor desired. Butler did not want to share the love of his subjects with rebels; he wanted to instill fear, and so he made it that under provisional governor James Garfield, the denizens of the rebel states were punished to the utmost.</p>
    <figure><img src="im2.png"><figcaption>“Mad Jim” Garfield.</figcaption></figure>
    <p><br>All who had taken up arms against the Union were barred from the vote in perpetuity; all who held an officer’s rank were put away to jail, deported far from home and into the territories that they may never be broken out. What actions earned Butler animosity in New Orleans were carried out across the Confederacy, as “Mad Jim”, losing his grip on reality and all his moral convictions with it, mercilessly killed any who dared lift a finger against the rule of his master. Indeed, those most brutally punished were those who had once dared to hold their fellow man in bondage – what terror they had inflicted upon the negro was now made their suffering by many more orders of magnitude.</p>
    <p><br>All the while, the baying hounds of the North cheered on their President, who walked freely amongst his fellow soldiers without fear of harm, for these were men of violence, and as long as the Beast and Mad Jim held control over the South, the supply of violence would never cease to flow. In that, it was useful to Butler that Jubal Early had escaped to Mexico at the war’s end—in fact, he had allowed it, knowing that masses of “Confederados” would follow him there. Without an enemy to rally the people against, he could not have possibly held onto power in the way that he did. And so Early and his filibusters made their way through Central America, roaming aimlessly while attempting to rebuild their base of power to retake the South from the tyranny of that Satanic rogue, Butler, whose name was spoken in curses by all good Southern men who vowed revenge for what had been done to their homeland.</p>
    <figure><img src="im3.png"><figcaption>Jubal Early.</figcaption></figure>
    <p><br>In the year of his coming to power, concepts such as equal rights and universal suffrage would be rightly thought of as incredulous. But the Beast had a funny way of shifting the window of public opinion—when he forced through numerous civil rights bills in the late sixties, it was expected that Southerners would only intensify their resistance to Union rule, and that they did. But unlike many others, Butler was adamant on committing every possible resource to enforce his acts. Every consequent rebellion and coastal invasion by Confederate exiles only galvanized his support in the North; soon enough, the once-radical idea of permitting black men the vote became a dearly-held tenet of American liberalism. Once that was accomplished, women’s suffrage would not be too far off. And with each group that he enfranchised, Butler gained a new, devotedly loyal base of support with which he could win his elections by increasingly staggering margins.</p>
    <figure><img src="im4.png"><figcaption>“Wide Awakes”, parading in Manhattan.</figcaption></figure>
    <p><br>With the support of his equally shrewd cabinet of Radicals, the patronage he extended to these groups for education and employment increased their power within society, and their place among the elite. By appeasing industrialists, Butler built a railroad, and with the money he earned by graft, the newspapers were bought out, and those that resisted were shut down. The American spirit of rugged individualism was not stamped out, nay, but instead became deluded into submission and, ultimately, unyielding and unquestioning love of liberty’s guarantor. The Wide Awakes, once a disorganized social club for rowdy, idealistic youths, now became an integral component of the American way of life.</p>
    <p><br>To do your national service was to spy on your neighbor; love of country was love of reporting those contemners of the new state of affairs directly to the local branch chapter, and seeing that they would never again dare to betray the ideals of the Republic. In every saloon, tenement, workhouse and plaza in the country, there they would be, whether you knew it or not. It might not take much. Perhaps your friend would ask your opinion on the President’s new tariff prerogative. And you, knowing no better, might dare to state your plain disagreement. And then you would catch a glimpse, just one fleeting look, of a young man in the corner wearing the red shirt and blue sash. And then you would know the error of your ways.</p>
    <figure><img src="im5.png"><figcaption>Pres. Butler.</figcaption></figure>
    <p><br>Political power in the South would never return to those who made rebellion against the government, to that end Butler was committed. With Black voting guaranteed and encouraged, and the land of plantation owners now doled out freely among them, those once called “negroes” were now called “sir”, as the black man became the <i>nouveau riche</i> of the New South. Because at the end of the day, what will drive a man to give you his unflinching loyalty more than moral integrity and love of country, is that which one may delude himself into believing is anything but the root of all evil. Any man in his right mind, no matter the color of his skin, knew that the Republican Party would take care of him, if only that he took care of the Republican Party. With each passing headline reporting the arrest of a Democratic Party boss, a Tammany Hall leader, a Knight of the Golden Circle, a Klansman, so did the strength of America’s love for Butler grow. It grew, and grew, and grew, until that love was so great that every man would put his life on the line for the President if only it would be asked of him.</p>
    <p><br>And so, with each passing cycle, the American people would continue to show just how much they loved democracy, and loved the President. And with each successive term, the margin for Butler would grow, and grow, and grow some more. It was tricky at first. Horatio Seymour put up a good fight, but found quickly that white supremacy was a relic of a bygone era. The last stand of the Democrats came in 1872, when Fernando Wood bravely denounced the “tyranny” of the President and promised a return to normalcy. For this he was laughed at and mocked, his supporters beaten and bloodied, until ultimately his folly was proven with a defeat so decisive that the party never recovered. It was known full well by the common man that to have liberty, it must be nourished and kept sacred, and Benjamin Butler was liberty’s guardian. In him they put their trust, and from them did they receive prosperity for all time.</p>
