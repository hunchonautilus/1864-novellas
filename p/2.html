    <p><br><br><br><br>Yes, the deep-rooted desire by the Radicals for revenge—revenge for Bleeding Kansas, revenge for Dred Scott, revenge for John Brown, revenge for centuries of evil foisted upon their fellow human beings—gave way to a uniquely American radicalism. Old statues were torn down, old heroes forgotten. New statues would come to dot the land: John Brown bearing arms against evil; Nat Turner leading his people to freedom; Giuseppe Garibaldi carrying on the fight against imperialism in all its forms; in 1871, Friedrich Hecker returned to Baden with the full support of the American government, fomenting a revolution that undid the careful work of the Kaiser and his lapdog, Bismarck, in uniting Germany under the boots and guns of Prussianism. And in its darkest moment, when the Paris Commune stood in defiance against the monarchists and invaders, all of France stood with it. No longer was power handed down by God to anointed Kings. When Wilhelm I and Napoleon III found themselves on the gallows, they realized that one universal truth, that power could only be legitimately derived from the will of the people.</p>

    <p><br>So it was that Karl Marx came to America, and seeing the extent to which the new American system instilled in its workers a powerful class consciousness, went back to London with hope for the future. So the revolution was exported abroad, and what started in 1848 found its home in America, and culminated in heads rolling all across Europe. When the Spanish Republic was overthrown in 1874, it was Butler’s Redshirts who sailed across the ocean to meet their French brethren and continue the revolution in the name of liberty. Tyrants and kings the continent wide trembled in fear of a beast now unleashed, the old tenets of American isolation quickly abandoned by the sheer drive and willpower of an uncompromising leader determined to sunder the seat of every oppressing monarch of the earth.</p>
    <p><br>While the ideas of Butlerism did not take hold too far outside the most westerly portions of Europe, the entire globe would be shattered by its impact. When men learned to love each other as brothers, when the rich remembered to fear the poor, the internecine European squabbles like those which instigated Napoleon’s wars became a thing of the past. The conflicts of the future would not be fought in colonial competition nor militaristic hunger for power and glory—to the masses of the new continental order, there could be no war but class war. The long shadow of Butler cast itself over Europe as competing ideologues battled to continue his fight, or repudiate his ideas. Communists fought liberals, who fought monarchists, who fought communists.</p>
    <p><br>While the last vestiges of colonial empires were torn apart abroad, Europe readily resumed the hostilities of 1848 along the same lines, tearing the continent apart in a conflagration of the like never seen before on this earth. By the end of it, liberal republics dotted the German Confederation led by the twin powers of Baden and Bavaria; the French Commune consolidated its power and swore to uphold the rights of men, both at home and abroad; the monarchies of England, Italy and Austria with its German satellites survived, though not before implementing vast reforms to ward off the terror that awaited them from their indigent classes. Over the decades to follow, the Poles would similarly strive for their independence, and each subsequent rebellion would be met with escalating brutality from Kaisers and Tsars, who knew that they could not hold back the flood tides forever.</p>
    <p><br>By the end of the seventies, little remained of Britain’s great empire. Inspired by the example of their southerly neighbors, the old Patriotes of Ontario and Quebec were given hope, and rebelled once more to establish their own Republic. In the West, Louis Riel redeemed the Métis people with the proclamation of the Red River Confederacy in 1879, expelling the colonizers of his beloved Manitoba while his compatriots in the Hunters’ Lodges threw out all Tories who dared impose the Queen’s rule over dear Canada. Butler-backed Fenian raids terrified the English ruling class, and after intense risings and with the President’s spirited backing, Ireland won its independence in 1880, with Charles Stewart Parnell as the first President of Dáil Éireann.</p>

    <p><br>The joyous return of many Irishmen to their homeland was celebrated across the Union, and a major source of strife in the domestic political sphere was expunged. It seemed that there was nowhere in the civilized world quite safe from the export of the Second American Revolution and its ideas. Though the Tory presses would decry him a madman, they could do little as the Butlerites of England agitated for their own class empowerment. The Chartist revival, alive and well, inspired fearless courage from working class Victorians and liberal suffragettes. By the turn of the next century, a proletarian revolution there could only be a matter of time.</p>
    <p><br>In the new American society, every force which could dare resist the new normal was aggressively co-opted by the state. Brigham Young found himself helpless to resist as his flock, once shunned by the government, realized what riches lay ahead now that Butler had promised the son of Joseph Smith a safe future for the Mormons in exchange for his fealty as Governor of the Deseret Territory. Mexico became little more than a client state as the Porfiriato took on an increasingly radical tone, and found itself subordinate to the will of the United States. The Germans of the Old Northwest, long the backbone of the Republican Party, forged ahead in settling the vast plains to the west, providing the most enthusiastic recruits to the Union Army fighting for revolution abroad, and the Wide Awakes enforcing liberal values by bayonet point at home against all rebels and traitors. Carl Schurz told his old friend Hecker that these were not the ideals they had fought for as Forty-Eighters; Hecker turned him in.</p>

    <p><br>Germans would come to form the vanguard of Butler’s revolution; their farmers enchanted by the progressive economic policies of the time, the issuance of Greenbacks, and a high level of inflation that proved a boon to their wellbeing. Their industrial laborers benefited from a government that made haste to ensure that the rise of new technology would not come at too dear a cost to their prosperity. Equal parts liberal, socialist, and moderate, there was no group for which the Republican Party would not change its face on a dime if it would ensure their devoted loyalty.</p>
    <p><br>So said Jubal Early in his Resurrection Address of 1875 that Butler’s will had been imposed on good Southern men by a motley coalition of “Germans, Mormons, and Mulattos”. He received great fanfare for that speech when he landed on the southern coast of Florida, intent on using his large force of Confederate exiles to restore some semblance of normalcy to the land he loved, a land he was not quick enough to realize had been lost long ago. The landing and subsequent insurrection was brief, localized to only the deepest South, but it inspired hope among many disenfranchised whites who remembered the dream of the Confederacy, a dream that retained a burning passion in the hearts of those who were desperate for the restoration of the old order. It ended with an inglorious execution at the hands of Nathan Bedford Forrest, now a broken, defeated and wrathful man who knew better than to bet against the house.</p>
    <p><br>Off came Jubal Early’s head by stroke of the sword; it gave Forrest some pause as he remembered those days past when they fought side by side. There was no such hesitation for his co-conspirator Clement Vallandigham, whom Forrest dispatched without second thought by a revolver’s shot through the skull. By Garfield’s order, he had become a merciless weapon of the Republic; by his own order, Garfield destroyed any vestiges of humanity left in himself, and prostrated his soul to the cause of the Republic. The landing was a great vindication for Butler, as any doubts to the sincerity of his alarming proclamations that the remnants of the Confederate Army posed a real and active threat to the new liberty and prosperity brought during his reign evaporated. Putting down the Florida Rising gave the President the last component he needed to permanently transform American society and government to match the ideas of the cause for which he fought.</p>
