    <p><br><br><br><br>At the end of his life, the President grew concerned at the growing irregularity of reports from the Wide Awakes. How everyone was happy to carry out his will, but did not seem to take his commands as earnestly as they did before. How his once raptly attentive citizens no longer seemed to listen, they just… <i>kept going</i>. The man who built an empire of liberty behind the scenes now wondered if he truly was the puppetmaster of it all, and not the marionette. He used to revel in entering establishments hostile to him, hearing the bitter venom sang by his detractors, seeing their pallid faces when they realized his presence, and delighting in their compliance when he ordered them to keep singing. Now it seemed that all the songs about him were sung in praise. In love. Not in fear, but from a place of genuine, unquestioning devotion. And as the bald, shriveling President entered the last decrepit days of his life, he worried to himself about the possibility that he might very well have raised a generation whose defining trait was cognitive dissonance. He did not have the time to fully understand what would happen when he was no longer there to keep that unquestioning obedience alive.</p>
    <p><br><br><br><br>And so in 1893, when he finally expired after seventy-four years of living, when years of administrative decay could no longer be concealed under the facade of the all-knowing, all-loving father of the new American dream; when decades of class-conscious literature had perforated the minds of a new generation who took it for granted that their President always held their best interests in mind; when the party bureaucracy tidily picked a middling bureaucrat to take on the mantle of the Republic; when the Mormons realized that they were not growing any more prosperous, and the southern Blacks realized that their success was not made by their own enterprise, but instead the patronage of a government that didn’t need to demand their votes, because their votes would always be there; when Union men realized that the reason they never worried for their working conditions was because they had been fed news every day by the state-owned local paper about the newest arrest of a greedy industrialist they had never heard of; the nation understood quickly on what flimsy foundations their false dream was built.</p>
    <p><br><br><br><br>When the average American’s notion that their particular interest group was the primary beneficiary of the Republican Party’s love came crashing down, when they understood that the very literature they had read encouraging them to think for themselves had been training them to believe the truth that the party wanted them to see: when every American understood at once that he or she had been tricked into creating an organic cycle of ideological uniformity that was independent of the state’s machinations, that the revolutionary tradition instilled in them from a young age was actually a mechanism of control, they realized that the right to vote they held so dearly as the keystone of their democracy had been made irrelevant because they all voted for the same person anyway.</p>
    <p><br><br><br><br>When the collective stupor of an entire nation was finally lifted, the curtains thrown down, and the trick revealed: that they had lost the ability to distinguish truth from fiction, hopelessly lost in a sea of lies colliding with facts, their entire system of governance being the messiest yet most beautiful self-sustaining web of contradictions that had long ago ran far ahead of any direct intervention of the state, but had now grown to perpetuate itself on the basis that no one person ever knew too much to genuinely question the narrative they had been sold, and when one began to notice that those rare few bright souls who did had not been heard from in quite some time, they began to understand that there was a force at work beyond any one of them that had made unquestioning pawns of Americans in service of a higher purpose that none could possibly understand.</p>

    <p><br><br><br><br>When Americans finally understood the true nature of the Perpetual Republic, a phenomenon that had stripped them of their identity, their individuality, their very humanity, all while its victims uncritically cheered it on, they began to stir. When President George B. Cox was returned to office in 1896 by the same margins as his predecessor Butler, the increasingly resentful populace understood what they had suspected all along: there was never any intention to let them choose for themselves. And though he promised renewal, a reinvigoration of those radical ideas at the core of the Republic’s identity, what occurred instead was inertia. Assurances of the government holding the people’s best interests in mind became hollow. When even the quietest of agitators for the freedom to consider new ideas found themselves slandered, bullied or disappeared, that small chorus of dissent began to swell. And when labor began to press their demands to secure improvement upon their stagnant wages as inflation ate up their livelihoods, the true face of the state was revealed: a bureaucratic morass domineered by industrialists and machine politicians, determined to protect their interests and ensure that no one group ever became prosperous or powerful enough to challenge them.</p>
    <figure><img src="im15.png"></figure>
    <p><br><br><br><br>So it came to pass that the nation began to distrust their newspapers. They began to ignore their fear of the Redshirt in the corner, and the Redshirt in the corner began to question what cause he served. The youth of America stopped simply reading their radical curriculum, but began to analyze it and determine how to implement it. The poor blacks and whites of the South began to discuss why it was that the government pitted them against each other while they worked starvation wages for the company owning the land upon which they toiled. All across the nation, people began to speak out, realizing that they had solidarity in numbers, shedding their fear of the government and turning instead to courage. Few would dare at first to protest openly, because genuinely disruptive acts of protest outside of carefully-controlled performative activism had faded from the American political tradition. But when the first sign of real dissent was brutally beaten back by the forces of the state, it vindicated yet again the suspicions of the American people that they were not the ones truly in control.</p>
    <p><br><br><br><br>And so the fire began to burn brighter and brighter, and people began to push back more and more, finding out at each step the lengths the government would go in preserving the illusion that the good times were here to stay. But when those once glorified by the state became slandered by it, people saw through the tactics of division used so effectively by those at the top in years past. They would not fall for it this time.</p>
    <p><br><br><br><br>1900 came and went, and Cox was returned yet again with a margin only a messiah could boast, and so nobody believed it. The confidence of America was direly malnourished; its institutions on the precipice of total collapse; its people, resentful of their government and emboldened by its losing control of the narrative, cried out in a wave of discontent that crashed against the very foundations of the Republic like Neptune himself had forsaken it. After the “election” was concluded, the young Wide Awake leader, Alice Roosevelt, issued a nationwide strike call on behalf of a combined group of industrial syndicates. And no matter the government’s attempts to suppress it, she would make her voice heard, no matter how many presses had to be seized, no matter how many of her comrades had to suffer detention and abuse for their public outbursts of anger that rallied young men and women around the red flag bearing a white star, each demonstration and ensuing reaction bringing ever more radicalized workers of all stripes into the flock.</p>
    <figure><img src="im16.png"><figcaption>Alice Roosevelt.</figcaption></figure>
    <p><br><br><br><br>The call of Roosevelt was the call of the youth of America, who would no longer be taken for fools and sheep. Anarchist literature proliferated. Muckrakers published sensational exposes on government corruption that caught the eye of a weary public. Galleanists rallied in secret societies; educated children of old money determined to become the vanguard of a new revolution. Eugene Debs embarked on a speaking tour across the industry belt of the west, stirring up the fears and grievances of an American working class that finally realized it had nothing to lose but its chains. All it would take to light the tinderbox and make the decaying, otiose Republic combust in a fire hot enough to destroy it would be one simple act, the propaganda of the deed.</p>
    <p><br><br><br><br>And on one sunny day, when a young Leon Czogolsz saw his chance to seize the moment, levelled his pistol, and shot President Cox through the heart…</p>
    <p><br><br><br><br>The fall came fast, and it came hard.</p>
