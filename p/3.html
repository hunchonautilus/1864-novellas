    <p><br><br><br><br>Power was centralized in the hands of the federal government, which mobilized its loyal devotees across the nation to form assemblies that prioritized consensus over division. And what division could an assembly have when the great masses of its participants would shout down anyone who dared raise their voice against the cause? The bickering and inaction of Congress came to an end as the Senate was done away with; that vestige of aristocracy’s power had no place in the radical democratic tradition emerging by the popular will. The size of the national legislature was greatly expanded, so that every American community would have true representation. And when a new Congressman (or Congresswoman, as was made federal law in 1875) arrived in Washington, he or she would immediately be taken aback by the joy with which their colleagues carried themselves. The Republic had no need for partisan divides – under the wise guidance of Butler, that humble saint of liberty, the right solution would surely be found. Soon enough, he did not even need to rule through fear, as the genuine love and fanaticism that emerged from his terror took root.</p>
    <p><br><br><br><br>While the role of the states would be preserved in name, the President’s will was that all people of the nation come together as Americans, and so the autonomy of its constituent parts was stripped away until little remained. Power was devolved to the individual to such a degree that there could be no coordinated effort to act against the will of the chief magistrate. Through this, American democracy would be preserved in perpetuity by a new government determined not only to enforce its values at home, but to export them abroad, to secure kinship and brotherhood among all men of the world. At the heart of this sphere, this new commonwealth of liberty, would reside the beating heart that once composed the United States – no longer content to limit itself to confederalism, 1876 saw the joyous proclamation of a new state on the centennial anniversary of the old: the Union of the American Republic, though it was known in revolutionary literature and by its supporters and detractors alike as the <b>Perpetual Republic</b>.</p>
    <p><br><br><br><br>The cause of the Republic was one that demanded sacrifice. The cause demanded change. A new generation, borne of smoke and steel, were radicalized as they came of age. This was a generation of artisans, scholars, thinkers, <i>soldiers</i>. No longer would this be a country of states in disunion, no, that model had been tried, and found wanting. Gone were the stars of the individual states on that spangled banner, replaced by a single white star on a red canton that demonstrated the unity of the Perpetual Republic. In a manner seemingly a century ahead of its time, Americans began to understand words like racism. By order of the President, and the enforcement of his loyal followers in the Army and Wide Awake clubs, it became known to all that racism was an evil to be combatted. By way of force and intimidation, all legal barriers to black participation in society would come down; by way of education, racism would be eradicated in the next generation.<br><br><br></p>
    <figure><img src="im10a.png"><figcaption>Progress and Poverty.</figcaption></figure>
    <p><br><br>As the Industrial Revolution reshaped the face of the land, the educated, enfranchised housewife knew sexism, and the pauper knew what it meant to belong to the proletariat. The immigrant and the true-blooded American alike understood at once that it was not his fellow man who was determined to rob him of his right to a living, but the capitalist who picked both their pockets, then set them against each other. The renter knew that the cause of his poverty was not a stroke of bad luck nor the insufficiency of his work ethic, but indeed the speculator of the land upon which he worked, and the owner of the land he rented.</p>
    <p><br><br><br><br>The chameleonic Republican Party had used the power of industry to create unhalting economic growth. The common man saw progress like never before, and questioned how with it came unprecedented poverty. He found his answers in Henry George, Karl Marx, Daniel de Leon. And when it became clear to Butler that the industrialist face of the party would serve him no further use where industry existed, that he may earn the love of the new generation by letting them in on the wealth enjoyed by those years of growth, <i>socialism</i> became the new word of the day in the North. When it became clear that he could ensure the continual loyalty of the Blacks made rich by the dispossession of their oppressors by keeping them rich, <i>capitalism</i> was the great Republican virtue that kept the heart of the New South beating.</p>
    <p><br><br><br><br>And with each constitutional amendment backed by unanimous majorities, each career made and broken on the basis of one’s loyalty to the party and its will, it became understood in the President’s waning years that as long as he lived, he would never face opposition to his rule. But with that much power concentrated in one place, with each interest group totally subordinate to it, and with no worthy successor to take the reins who held such incredible devotion and respect in the hearts of his people…</p>

    <p><br><br><br><br>The industrial syndicates of the North could count on their President to defend their ownership of the means of production. The literate blacks of the South could count on their President to defend their freedom and property from an increasingly violent and reactionary white underclass. The radical youth the nation over could count on the long march of time to present the opportunity to climb over each other in a race to see who could best wield the awesome power of government in defense of the virtues they were brought up to hold, virtues their fathers had fought for in the War to End Slavery. And after receiving an education from the New Freedom Curriculum, the poor freedman’s son in Charleston might wonder why there persisted an unbridgeable gap between his status and that of the Black civil servant in New York. And the confident proletarian of Chicago might wonder about what life is like for that freedman’s son down south, but of course, it must be grand if he hasn’t come up here yet to work a factory job.</p>
    <p><br><br><br><br>And the young liberal of the burgeoning middle class might begin to wonder what happened to all those Indian tribes who seem to have all just disappeared around the time that the factories began opening. And he might wonder how it is possible that every newspaper in the entire country spoke in unison about the depths of their love for the President, the American Gracchus, and the vehicle of America’s success, the Republican Party. He might notice how they would use the same words time and time again. The same punctuation errors, the same unique quirks of prose. He might begin to wonder how it is that under Butler, utopia was achieved for the first time in human history, and everyone seemed just fine with it.</p>
    <p><br><br><br><br>He might wonder just how it is possible that the Republican Party could manage to give everyone what they wanted at the same time. And he might think to himself, where did those Irish boys I knew as a child end up anyway? And the kind Jewish shopkeeper who used to give me candy? Why is it that a people so proudly dedicated to the power of the individual all seem to have the same opinion about everything? And why is it that I have internalized the inevitability that the correct opinion always originates from the top down, despite being told all my life that what we have accomplished came from the ground up? And why is it that my friends and I attend the weekly meetings of our Republican Clubs to spread our ideas on how to fix the problems our country faces, only to find that we were all in agreement from the moment we arrived, and our unanimous solution always seems to be in accord with that of President Butler?</p>
    <p><br><br><br><br>And then he might wonder what will happen on the unthinkable day that the President dies.</p>
